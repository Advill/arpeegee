Crappy text-based rpg I work on in my spare time
This is what I... created... during my first year in AP Computer Science at school. I used it to teach myself some topics,
and to practice others.

Yes, it is horribly coded. I might go through and fix all of the style errors, but I don't think i will be continuing the game at all.
